Individuals tend to orientate themselves in accordance with the dominant side.\n\n##Statistical Test(s)\n* Wilcoxin rank-sum \n###Assumptions of the statistical test\n* independent errors\n* data is unmatched (as comparison across are being made for example)\n* samples are drawn from populations witht the same shape distribution\n```{r Q2_Handedness_and_ataxic_gait}\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n# import and view the dataset \nHandAtax <- read.csv(\"HandednessAtaxia.csv\")\nhandatax<- tbl_df(HandAtax)\nhandatax\n\n\n# explore dataset with plots\nboxplot(handatax$first_stumble~handatax$handedness)\n\n# to plot subsequent graphs in a single plot\npar(mfrow = c(1,2),\n    mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1),\n    oma = c(0, 0, 1, 0)) \n\nmosaicplot(handatax$handedness~handatax$first_stumble,\n           main = \"Handedness against position of first stumble\",\n           ylab = \"First Stumble (1= rightwards, 2 = leftwards)\",\n           xlab = \"Handedness (1 = right-handed, 2 = left-handed)\")\n\nmosaicplot(handatax$final_position~handatax$handedness,\n           main = \"Handedness against final position\",\n           ylab = \"Final Stimble (1= rightwards, 2 = leftwards)\",\n           xlab = \"Handedness (1 = right-handed, 2 = left-handed)\")\n\n\n# Statistical Test and co (hadedness against first stumble)\nwilcox.test(first_stumble~handedness, \n            data = handatax,\n            paired = FALSE)\n\n# Statistical Test and co (hadedness against first stumble)\nwilcox.test(final_position~handedness,\n            data = handatax,\n            paired = FALSE)\n\n# so that subsequent graphs are not faceted\npar(mfrow = c(1,1),\n    mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1),\n    oma = c(0, 0, 1, 0))            \n```\n##Outcome Analysis\n* The null hypothesis may be rejected as handedness was shown to be related with first stumble (_p_ <0.05) and final position (_p_ = 0.04). These results illustrate that intoxicated individuals are more likely to exhibit ataxic gait that is skewed to her/his dominant side.\n\n#QUESTION 3\n\n##Null Hypothesis\n* There is nor relationsip between running time and calories\n\n##Alternative Hypothesis\n* There is a directly proportional relatiolnship between running time and caloreies consumed\n\n##Statistical Test(s)\n* Linear Regression\n###Assumptions of the statistical test\n* linear relationship exists between the variables\n* independent observations\n* x variable measured without error\n* normally distributed residuals\n* homoskedastic residuals\n\n```{r Question 3}\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n# import and view dataset\ntimevscal <- read.csv(\"Timevscalories.csv\")\ntimcal <- tbl_df(timevscal)\ntimcal\n\n# plot the data\npar(mfrow = c(1,0),\n    mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1),\n    oma = c(0, 0, 1, 0))\n\nplot(timcal$calories~timcal$time,\n      main = \"Relationship between an amateur runner's running time and calories consumed\",\n           ylab = \"Calories Consumed (cal)\",\n           xlab = \"Running Time (s)\")\n\np <- qplot(x = time,\n           y = calories,\n           data = timcal,\n           main = \"Relationship between an amateur runner's running time and calories consumed\",\n           ylab = \"Calories Consumed (cal)\",\n           xlab = \"Running Time (s)\")\n\n# Calculate slope and intercept of line of best fit\ntimcal.coef <- coef(lm(calories~time, data = timcal))\ntimcal.coef\n\n\n# perform a Pearson Correlation and print the summary statistics\n\ntimcal.cor <- with(timcal, cor.test(method = 'pearson', x = time, y = calories))\ntimcal.cor\n\n# annotate r and p values onto the plot\n\np + annotate(\"text\", x = 2150, y = 420, label = \"r = -0.7\") + annotate(\"text\", x = 2150, y = 410, label = \"p = 0.002\") + geom_abline(intercept = 939.3, slope = -0.28)\n\n\n\n# to view the subsequent diagnostic graphs in a single plot\npar(mfrow = c(1,2),\n    mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1),\n    oma = c(0, 0, 1, 0))\n# perform and print  summary of linear regression\ntimcal.reg <- lm(calories~time, data = timcal)\nsummary(timcal.reg)\n\n# plots diagnostic plots for linear regression\n\nplot(x = timcal.reg$fitted.values,\n     y = timcal.reg$residuals,\n     xlab = \"Fitted Values\",\n     ylab = \"Residuals\",\n     main = \"Homoskedasticity of residuals\")\nabline(h = 0)\n\n# perform diagnostic plot to check for normality of residuals\nqqnorm(timcal.reg$residuals, main = \"Normal residula distribution\")\nqqline(timcal.reg$residuals)\n\n# give an overall title\nmtext(\"Diagnostic plots for linear regression analysis\", outer = TRUE)\n```\n##Outcome Analysis\n* The data fits all assumptions of a linear regression, including homoskedasticity and normal distribution of the residuals.\n* The variables have a fairly strong negative correlation (-0.07). Because the _p_ value is small (0.002), the null hypothesis can be rejected. \n* CONCLUSION: running time and calorie consumption are inversely proportional \n\n#QUESTION 4\n```{rQ4}\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\n\nfoo <- rnorm(10000, mean = 60, sd = 3) # final mark\nbar <- rnorm(10000, mean = 68, sd = 5) # project mark\nbaz <- rep(seq(from = 1997, to = 2006), each = 1) # years\n\nyear <- sample(baz, 150, replace = TRUE,\n               prob = c(0.05, 0.05, 0.08, 0.08, \n                          0.1, 0.13, 0.14, 0.13, 0.12, 0.12))\nproject_mark <- sample(bar, 150, replace = TRUE)\nfinal_mark <- sample(foo, 150, replace = TRUE)\n\nplot_data <- data_frame(year = year,\n                        project_mark = round(project_mark, 1),\n                        final_mark = round(final_mark, 1)) %>%\n    arrange(year)\n\n# view the dataset\nplot_data\n\n# use the gather function and change the \"year\" column class (tidying)\ndata_tidy <- plot_data %>%\n    mutate(year = factor(year)) %>%\n    gather(key = key, value = value, -year) %>%\n    arrange(year)\n\n# open the graphics device\npdf('FinalVSProjectMarks.pdf')\n\n# plot the data\nwith(data_tidy, boxplot(value ~ key,\n                        main = \"Comparison between final and project marks(%) between the years 1997 and 2006 for a BSc Honours in Physiology course\",\n                        ylab = \"Percentage\"))\n# close the graphics device\ndev.off()\n```\n\n\n\n",
